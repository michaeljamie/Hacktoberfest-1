Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity for new developers to make contributions to real  world projects and get involved with the communities that maintain those  projects. All of this      happens through the GitHub code hosting service.  That can be a hurdle for anyone who's not familiar with Git or GitHub. If you want to participate in Hacktoberfest, but you don't have much experience with GitHub, then you've come to the right place.

Rules :

    To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests between October 1–31 in any timezone
    The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
    Pull requests reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt.

Let’s start with few common questions!

Q.What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software in partnership with Github .

Q.What if my pull requests aren’t accepted?

Even if your pull requests aren’t accepted, as long as you open at least 4 pull requests, you’ll earn the shirt.

Q. What will you get if you participate in it ?
